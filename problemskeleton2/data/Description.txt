Sample cases
- sample1: Matches statement example with k=2 and mixed word lengths/scores.
- sample2: Matches statement example with k=1 to show immediate answers.

Secret cases
- secret01: Minimum n=k=1 sanity.
- secret02: Two single-character extremes to check k=n behavior.
- secret03: All identical words to ensure duplicates are counted separately with tie-break on arrival.
- secret04: Mix of punctuation/high ASCII vs low to test ordering.
- secret05: Long vs short words and punctuation-heavy words to stress sums.
- secret06: k=1 with varied lengths; should always output current extrema.
- secret07: Simple incremental list with k=3.
- secret08: Alternating upper/lower pairs; deliberate ties with deterministic arrival tie-break.
- secret09: Crafted pairs with equal/near-equal evilness to test tie handling.
- secret10: Repetitions with growing length; k=2 keeps moving boundary.
- secret11: k near n with duplicates and varied scores.
- secret12: Random small words; k mid-range.
- secret13: Random up to length 12; k=10 for mid tracking.
- secret14: 50 single-character words from a fixed high/low set; many ties.
- secret15: 80 random small words; k=40.
- secret16: 5,000 single-character words; k=2,500 to stress streaming.
- secret17: 200 random length-20 words; k=50.
- secret18: 1,000 words with k close to n (990) to test deep ranks.
- secret19: 150 random words up to length 30; small k=2.
- secret20: 50,000 single-character words; k=25,000 to push O(n log k).
- secret21: 100,000 single-character words; k=50,000 for max stress test.
