\problemname{The Evil Word}

You are writing an essay for a notoriously strict professor who believes that certain \emph{words} carry
``evil energy.'' The professor measures the \emph{evilness} of a word by summing the ASCII values of all
characters it contains. A word with a larger total ASCII score is considered more evil.

Formally, for a word $\text{w}$ with characters $\text{w}[1], \dots, \text{w}[|\text{w}|]$, its evilness is
\[
    E(\text{w}) \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^{|\text{w}|} \text{ASCII}(\text{w}[i]).
\]

The professor's old text-processing machine does not store the full essay. Instead, it receives the input
\emph{\textbf{one word at a time}}, each word arriving as a stream of characters on a single line. As soon as
a word has been fully read, the machine computes its evilness $E(\text{w})$ and then immediately discards the
characters themselves, keeping only a small number of candidate evilness values in memory.

After each new word is processed, the professor wants to know \emph{both}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the current \textbf{$k$-th least evil word}, and
    \item the current \textbf{$k$-th most evil word},
\end{itemize}
among all words seen so far, according to their evilness scores.

These rankings are computed over the \textbf{multiset of evilness scores}, counting duplicates.
If multiple words share the same score, ties are broken by arrival order: a word that appears \emph{later} in the input is considered more evil than an earlier word with the same score. This makes each query's answer unique.

If fewer than $k$ words have appeared so far, the professor is not satisfied with either query and expects
you to output ``-'' in its place.

\section*{Input}

The input begins with a single line containing two integers $n$ and $k$, where
\[
    1 \le k \le n \le 200\,000.
\]

The next $n$ lines each contain exactly one word, consisting only of printable ASCII characters
(codes 33 to 126, from \texttt{!} to \texttt{\~}).  
Each line provides the complete stream of characters for that word.

\section*{Output}

Output exactly $n$ lines.

After processing the $i$-th word, print two space-separated tokens describing the current
\emph{$k$-th least evil} and \emph{$k$-th most evil} words among all words seen so far (using the tie-breaking rule above):
\begin{itemize}
    \item If fewer than $k$ words have been processed, print \texttt{- -}.
    \item Otherwise, print \texttt{$L$ $R$}, where \texttt{$L$} is any word whose evilness is the $k$-th smallest
          among all scores seen so far, and \texttt{$R$} is any word whose evilness is the $k$-th largest.
\end{itemize}

If several words share the same evilness score, any valid choice for \texttt{L} or \texttt{R} will be accepted.
