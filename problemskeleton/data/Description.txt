Sample cases
- sample1: Short numeric string; k=2 exercises a simple mid-rank pick.
- sample2: Mixed lower/punctuation to highlight ASCII ordering.
- sample3: Repeated highs/lows so duplicates matter for intermediate k.

Secret cases
- secret01: Minimum size n=1, k=1 sanity.
- secret02: Two characters with k=n to confirm trailing rank.
- secret03: All identical characters; any k should return the same value.
- secret04: k=1 with descending digits and punctuation to confirm max pick.
- secret05: k=n with mixed upper/lower letters to cross ASCII classes.
- secret06: Alternating extremes (~ vs ! and runs of *) to stress duplicate counting.
- secret07: Mostly mid-ASCII 'M' with random spikes and k=50.
- secret08–secret12: Random medium strings (length 20–80) with random k values.
- secret13: Bursty runs of high '~' vs low 'A' to test handling of large duplicate blocks.
- secret14: Strictly increasing ASCII sequence; k hits early in the order.
- secret15: Strictly decreasing ASCII sequence; k near the tail.
- secret16: Medium random string with k=1 to test maximum extraction.
- secret17: Medium random string with k close to n (near-minimum character).
- secret18: 2,000 mostly low '#' characters with 25 high '~' spikes; k targets the spikes.
- secret19: Structured digits, uppercase, and lowercase runs; large k checks cross-category ordering.
- secret20: Near-maximum length (200,000) fully random string; k=150,000 stresses time and memory.
