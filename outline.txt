Writing one Kattis problem

Background:
In the world of competitive programming, problem design is as intellectually
demanding and creatively rewarding as problem solving itself. This assessment
invites you to step into the role of a problem setter, a crucial figure in
programming contests, by crafting your own original Kattis-style problem.
Through this exercise, you will deepen your grasp of algorithmic thinking and
computational constraints, while honing your ability to communicate complex
technical ideas with clarity and precision.

Important Preparation:
Before proceeding with the development of your problem, it is essential that
you carefully review the resources provided.

• First, download and thoroughly examine the file named problemskeleton.zip
  available on MyCourses. This archive contains a template that you are
  expected to use as the foundation for your submission. Make sure to
  understand its structure and fill in all relevant sections appropriately.

• Second, you must read the official documentation on the Kattis problem
  package format, which outlines the required components and conventions for
  problem submissions: https://www.kattis.com/problem-package-format/

• Third, read the following guidelines on writing programming contest problems
  by Greg Hamerly: https://cs.baylor.edu/~hamerly/courses/4144_22s/writing_problems.txt

Failure to consult these resources may result in incomplete or invalid
submissions. Please review both the template and documentation carefully.

Submission Requirements:
You must submit the following materials to MyCourses by the deadline:

Deliverable 1: A description of your original problem
-----------------------------------------------------
You must submit a LaTeX document presenting a clear and complete problem
statement. The submission must include:

• A detailed and precise problem statement
• Clear input and output specifications
• At least one sample input/output pair
• At least one original visual element (illustration or figure)

Important:
The LaTeX file must be edited inside the problem statement folder in
problemskeleton. Read the README.txt and template comments before beginning.

Deliverable 2: One Correct and Efficient Solution
-------------------------------------------------
Implement one correct, efficient, well-structured, and well-documented
solution in **each** of the following languages:

• C++
• Java
• Python 3

Each solution must be a single file inside: submissions/accepted/

Deliverable 3: One Incorrect or Inefficient Solution
----------------------------------------------------
Implement at least one incorrect or inefficient solution demonstrating a
typical Kattis failure mode:

• Wrong Answer
• Time Limit Exceeded
• Memory Limit Exceeded

Place it in the appropriate folder inside submissions/.

Deliverable 4: Test-Case Generator
----------------------------------
Implement a test-case generator (C++/Java/Python) that produces valid inputs
and outputs. Must include:

• Hand-crafted edge cases
• Randomly generated cases
• Adequate coverage

Place it inside: test_case_generator/

Deliverable 5: Input Files
--------------------------
You must provide:

• Sample Inputs: at least 3 files
• Secret Inputs: at least 20 files

All must end in `.in`.  
Total combined size < 500 KB.

Organize under:

• data/sample/
• data/secret/

You must include **Description.txt** explaining what each input tests:
• Edge cases
• Large / TLE cases
• Complicated random cases
• Normal random cases

Deliverable 6: Output Files
---------------------------
You must submit corresponding `.ans` files for each `.in` file.

• Names must match exactly.
• Total input file size < 500 KB.

Deliverable 7: Input Validator
------------------------------
Create an input validator that:

• Returns exit code **42** if input is valid  
• Returns a different code if invalid  
• Must match exactly the input format described in your statement  

Place it inside: input_format_validators/

Read the README in that folder before writing the validator.

Deliverable 8: Presentation
---------------------------
Prepare a 20-minute slide deck. Requirements:

• Clear, concise, visually engaging
• Avoid text-heavy slides
• Include at least one slide summarizing each deliverable
• Include experiments and visualizations

You may be asked questions such as:

1. Deliverable 1: Problem Statement
   • What inspired your design?
   • Why illustration or figure?
   • How was it created?
   • Significance of the title?
   • How were input constraints determined?
   • Why choose the sample cases?
   • Estimated difficulty?

2. Deliverable 2: Correct Solution
   • Time and space complexity?
   • More efficient possible?
   • Could a slower solution pass?
   • Which language performed best?
   • Best vs worst-case behavior?

3. Deliverable 3: Incorrect Solution
   • Complexity?
   • Why incorrect?
   • How many tests does it fail?
   • Does it fail in all languages?

4. Deliverables 5 & 6: Test Cases
   • Which edge cases did you include?
   • Balance of cases?
   • Any deliberately excluded cases?

5. Deliverables 4 & 7: Generator + Validator
   • What challenges?
   • How ensure completeness?
   • How handle malformed inputs?

6. Deliverable 8: Presentation
   • What did you learn?
   • How was your collaboration?
   • Use of LLM tools?
   • What would you improve?
